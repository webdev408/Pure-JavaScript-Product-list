This is a simple product list. Here no framework or library is used in its creation. Purely vanilla JavaScript is used to achieve functionalities like creating and deleting items from the product list. The data is stored in the data.js file and is imported in the app.js file to read in the browser. I would like to claim that this is achieved with the most efficient way with less than 50 lines of code including css. A simple app with full functionality based on vanill Javascript.
